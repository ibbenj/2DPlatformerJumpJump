A multi-level 2D platformer game made using Unity (and an asset packet from the Unity Store).

Using a, d and the space bar, try to get the Frog to the goal (black hole) while collecting as many apples as you can. Watch out for holes and monsters on the way. Includes title screen and four levels. Obstacles include moving platforms, falling monsters (kind of like Thwomps from the Mario Franchise, falling platforms that respawn, lava, moving animated saws and ladders to climb up.
